# skip over the best chosen net sig PA for spectra in specskip.txt (simply because they don't look right to the eye but the code failed to reject them)
# but check if averaging over all PAs gives a better result
# there are still some nan's in the fluxes
# some spectra are being plotted twice. this probably affects the median too.
# the median points are being plotted at the start of the delta_lambda interval. They should be in the middle.
# why do Ferreras etal 2009 (who selected early type galaxies visually) get more red sequence galaxies than blue cloud galaxies and I get the exact opposite thing?? WTF?
---They selected galaxies that looked like early types (i.e. spheroidals). So it makes sense that they would have more red galaxies than blue.
# the error bars are still wrong
# I see a label repeated twice. This shouldn't happen unless it is somehow selecting more than one PA.
