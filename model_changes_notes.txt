1. convolution with galaxy profile?
2. inclusion of dust in models?

#### Comments/Solutions ####
1. you might only need to convolve with the galaxy profile only for the largest i.e. most massive galaxies. For a first step just try to include the redshift errors and only then include the PEARS LSFs (ask Sangeeta for the PEARS LSFs). 

Actually try looking at the sizes of galaxies that are not massive and see how much smaller they are than say red sequence galaxies.
Ex: Say a red-sequence galaxy has a size of 10 pixels. The PEARS data which is from the ACS grism has a dispersion of 40A/pix that means that a feature like the 4000A break can be shifted by 40A/pix x 10pix = 400A which is significant.
Also realize that a redshift error of 5% can cause a shift of 0.05 x 4000A = 200A for the 4000A break. So in this case both the effects are significant.

So, look at the sizes (get a mean/median) and see if the effect of morphological broadening is significant compared to the effect of redshift uncertainties.

The reason why the 3D-HST grism stacking papers needed to convolve the models with the galaxy profile is -- they divide by the continuum i.e. they were just trying to fit the minute absorption features like Ca and Mg absorption. Because these features are spread over a narrow wavelength they are affected significantly by the galaxy morphology along the dispersion direction.

2. you probably do need to include dust because you are taking the continuum and its slope into account.

The reason why the 3D-HST grism stacking papers did not include dust in their models is -- they divide by the continuum i.e. they were just trying to fit the minute absorption features like Ca and Mg absorption. Because these features are spread over a narrow wavelength they will not be affected very much by dust.
